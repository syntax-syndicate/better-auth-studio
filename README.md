## 🚀 Quick Start

### Hosted Version

For the hosted version: **[better-auth.build](https://better-auth.build)**

### Installation

📖 **[Documentation](https://better-auth-studio.vercel.app)**

**Recommended: Install as a dev dependency** (for project-specific versions):

```bash
pnpm add -D better-auth-studio
```

Or install globally using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm add -g better-auth-studio
```

Or use pnpx to run it without installation:

```bash
pnpx better-auth-studio [cmd]
```

### Basic Usage

1. **Navigate to your Better Auth project directory**

   ```bash
   cd your-better-auth-project
   ```

2. **Start the studio**

   If installed as dev dependency:

   ```bash
   pnpm better-auth-studio start
   ```

   Or with pnpx:

   ```bash
   pnpx better-auth-studio start
   ```

3. **Open your browser**
   - The studio will automatically open at `http://localhost:3000`
   - Or manually navigate to the URL shown in the terminal

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before using Better Auth Studio, ensure you have:

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **A Better Auth project** with a valid `auth.ts` configuration file
- **Database setup** (Prisma, Drizzle, or SQLite)

## 🔧 Configuration

### Supported Database Adapters

Better Auth Studio automatically detects and works with:

- **Prisma** (`prismaAdapter`)
- **Drizzle** (`drizzleAdapter`)
- **SQLite** (`new Database()` from better-sqlite3)
- **PostgreSQL** (via Prisma or Drizzle)
- **MySQL** (via Prisma or Drizzle)

### Example Configuration Files

#### Prisma Setup

```typescript
// auth.ts
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { prismaAdapter } from "better-auth/adapters/prisma";
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: prismaAdapter(prisma, {
    provider: "postgresql", // or "mysql", "sqlite"
  }),
  // ... other config
});
```

#### Drizzle Setup

```typescript
// auth.ts
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { drizzleAdapter } from "better-auth/adapters/drizzle";
import { db } from "./database";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: drizzleAdapter(db, {
    provider: "pg", // or "mysql", "sqlite"
  }),
  // ... other config
});
```

#### SQLite Setup

```typescript
// auth.ts
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import Database from "better-sqlite3";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: new Database("./better-auth.db"),
  // ... other config
});
```

## 🎯 Features

### 📊 Dashboard

- **Overview statistics** - User, teams and organization counts data

### 👥 User Management

- **View all users** - Paginated list with search and filtering
- **Create users** - Add new users with email/password
- **Edit users** - Update user information, email verification status
- **Delete users** - Remove users from the system
- **Bulk operations** - Seed multiple test users
- **User details** - View user profiles, and accounts
- **Last seen** - When events are enabled, the studio injects an optional `lastSeenAt` field on the user model and updates it on each sign-in or session creation. Run your database migration (e.g. `prisma migrate dev` or Drizzle push) to add the `lastSeenAt` column to the user table.

### 🏢 Organization Management

- **View organizations** - List all organizations with pagination
- **Create organizations** - Add new organizations with custom slugs

### ⚙️ Settings & Configuration

- **Plugin status** - Check which Better Auth plugins are enabled
- **Database configuration** - View current database adapter and settings
- **Social providers** - Configure OAuth providers (GitHub, Google, etc.)
- **Email settings** - Configure email verification and password reset

## 🛠️ Command Line Options

### Start Studio

```bash
pnpx better-auth-studio start [options]
```

**Options:**

- `--port <number>` - Specify port (default: 3002)
- `--host <string>` - Specify host (default: localhost)
- `--no-open` - Don't automatically open browser
- `--config <path>` - Path to auth config file (default: auto-detect)
- `--watch` - Watch for changes in auth config file and reload server automatically

`3002` is just the standalone Studio default so it does not clash with apps that already use `3000`. You can run Studio on `3000`, `4000`, or any other free port.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Start on custom port (if installed as dev dependency)
pnpm better-auth-studio start --port 3001

# Or with pnpx
pnpx better-auth-studio start --port 3001

# Start without opening browser
pnpm better-auth-studio start --no-open

# Use custom config file
pnpm better-auth-studio start --config ./custom-auth.ts

# Enable watch mode for auto-reload on config changes
pnpm better-auth-studio start --watch

# Combine multiple options
pnpx better-auth-studio start --port 3001 --watch --config ./src/auth.ts
```

### Using `--config` Option

Specify a custom path to your auth config file when it's in a non-standard location or auto-detection fails.

**Example:**

```bash
# With relative path
pnpm better-auth-studio start --config ./src/lib/auth.ts

# With absolute path
pnpm better-auth-studio start --config /path/to/project/auth.ts
```

**How it works:** Studio automatically searches for config files in common locations (`auth.ts`, `src/auth.ts`, `lib/auth.ts`, etc.). Use `--config` to specify a custom path when needed.

### Using `--watch` Option

Automatically reload the server when your `auth.ts` file changes. Perfect for development when iterating on your auth configuration.

**Example:**

```bash
# Start with watch mode enabled
pnpx better-auth-studio start --watch
```

**How it works:** Monitors your auth config file for changes, automatically restarts the server, and updates the browser UI via WebSocket - no manual refresh needed.

### Other Commands

```bash
# Check version
pnpx better-auth-studio --version

# Show help
pnpx better-auth-studio --help
```

## 🏠 Self-Hosting (Beta)

> ⚠️ **Beta Feature**: Self-hosting is currently in beta. Please report any issues on GitHub.

Deploy Better Auth Studio alongside your application for production use.

### Installation for Self-Hosting

**Important:** For self-hosting, install `better-auth-studio` as a **regular dependency** (not devDependency) since it's required at runtime in production:

```bash
pnpm add better-auth-studio
```

> **Note:** The CLI usage (standalone studio) can be installed as a dev dependency, but self-hosting requires it in `dependencies` for production deployments.

### Docker (Standalone Self-Host)

If you want to run Better Auth Studio in its own container, this repository includes a Docker setup for the standalone CLI server.

This mode is useful when:

- you want a separate admin container
- your Better Auth app already lives in its own repository
- you want Docker-managed `node_modules` and package-manager cache volumes

> **Important:** The standalone container still needs your Better Auth project mounted into it, because Studio loads your real `auth.ts` and `studio.config.*` files at runtime.

Build the image from this repository:

```bash
docker build -t better-auth-studio:self-host .
```

Run it with Docker Compose:

```bash
HOST_PROJECT_PATH=/absolute/path/to/your-better-auth-project \
CONFIG_PATH=./auth.ts \
docker compose -f docker/compose.yml up --build
```

If your auth config is not at the project root, pass it explicitly:

```bash
HOST_PROJECT_PATH=/absolute/path/to/your-better-auth-project \
CONFIG_PATH=./src/lib/auth.ts \
docker compose -f docker/compose.yml up --build
```

If you already used the older filename, `docker/docker-compose.self-host.yml` still works too.

What the container does:

- mounts your Better Auth project into `/workspace`
- installs project dependencies into Docker volumes on first boot
- starts `better-auth-studio start --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3002 --no-open`

Useful environment variables:

- `HOST_PROJECT_PATH` - absolute path to your Better Auth project on the host machine
- `CONFIG_PATH` - optional auth config path inside the mounted project, for example `./src/lib/auth.ts`
- `PORT` - studio port, defaults to `3002`
- `WATCH` - set to `true` to enable watch mode
- `AUTO_INSTALL` - set to `false` if your container/project already has dependencies installed
- `PROJECT_INSTALL_CMD` - optional custom install command for non-standard setups
- `GEO_DB_PATH` - optional GeoLite database path inside the mounted project

If you change the Studio port, make sure your Better Auth config also trusts that origin when needed. The examples usually include both `http://localhost:3000` and `http://localhost:3002` for that reason.

If you already embed Studio in your server with the framework adapters below, that remains the recommended production setup. The Docker flow is mainly for running the standalone Studio server in a containerized environment.

### Setup

**Step 1: Initialize configuration**

```bash
pnpx better-auth-studio init
```

This creates a `studio.config.ts` file:

```typescript
import type { StudioConfig } from "better-auth-studio";
import { auth } from "./lib/auth";

const config: StudioConfig = {
  auth,
  basePath: "/api/studio",
  metadata: {
    title: "Admin Dashboard",
    theme: "dark",
  },
  access: {
    roles: ["admin"],
    allowEmails: ["admin@example.com"],
    allowIpAddresses: ["127.0.0.1", "::1", "192.168.*"],
    blockIpAddresses: ["203.0.113.45"],
  },
};

export default config;
```

### Next.js (App Router)

The init command automatically creates `app/api/studio/[[...path]]/route.ts`:

```typescript
import { betterAuthStudio } from "better-auth-studio/nextjs";
import studioConfig from "@/studio.config";

const handler = betterAuthStudio(studioConfig);

export { handler as GET, handler as POST, handler as PUT, handler as DELETE, handler as PATCH };
```

Access at `http://localhost:3000/api/studio`

### Express

Add the studio handler to your server:

```typescript
import express from "express";
import { toNodeHandler } from "better-auth/node";
import { betterAuthStudio } from "better-auth-studio/express";
import { auth } from "./auth";
import studioConfig from "./studio.config";

const app = express();

app.use(express.json());
app.use("/api/studio", betterAuthStudio(studioConfig));
app.all("/api/auth/*", toNodeHandler(auth));

app.listen(3000);
```

Access at `http://localhost:3000/api/studio`
